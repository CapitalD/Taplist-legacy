Taplist
=======

v0.2

Simple beer tap listing using a json data source.  Responsive listing page displays what's on tap, and an admin page to manage the json data.


index.html
----------
The front-end.  Displays the data from the taplist.json.  Currently optimised for three taps, but the plan is for it to adapt correctly based on the data provided.


json_admin.html
---------------
The back-end.  A form to manage the json data.  Currently optimised for three taps, but the plan is for it to adapt correctly based on the data provided.
